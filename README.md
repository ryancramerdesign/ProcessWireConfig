ProcessWire Config Module
=========================

Module that enables you to customize most ProcessWire $config settings 
from an admin tool under Setup > Config. Previously you could only 
modify these $config settings by editing your /site/config.php file.

This module also enables you to add your own custom config settings that 
can be managed by this tool. Custom config settings may serve as 
replacements for some of the situations where you might have used custom
fields on pages. For instance, I have seen some people create one-off /
single use fields for things like "site title". This tool provides a
potentially more efficient means of defining those kinds of things. 

Requires: ProcessWire 2.5.10 or later.
